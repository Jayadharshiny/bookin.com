    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Bookin</strong> is an initiative aimed at making education more accessible and affordable by offering second-hand academic books at fair prices. 
      Founded by a student who understands the financial challenges of buying new textbooks, our platform connects learners with gently used booksâ€”often priced at 50% or less than their original cost. 
      All books are reviewed for quality, and key details such as markings or highlights are clearly mentioned. 
      We believe in honesty, sustainability, and supporting education through simple, trustworthy solutions. 
      Thank you for choosing Bookin.
